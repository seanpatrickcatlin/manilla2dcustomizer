TODO:

BUGS:
- Uninstaller requires a restart some times
- Uninstaller does not delete "\Program Files\M2DC" folder HTCHomeSetting-BACKUP.xml
- Read "\Windows" directory and "\Program Files\M2DC" directory dynamically
- Restore Defaults needs to actually restore the default tab names and enabled states, not just copy over a whole file
-
