BUGS:

- Uninstaller requires a restart some times

- Uninstaller does not delete "\Program Files\M2DC" folder HTCHomeSetting-BACKUP.xml

- Read "\Windows" directory and "\Program Files\M2DC" directory dynamically (SHGetSpecialFolderPath)

- Restore Defaults needs to actually restore the default tab names and enabled states, not just copy over a whole file

- No Landscape/320x320/vga,qvga support (only 320x240 right now) http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa454895.aspx
