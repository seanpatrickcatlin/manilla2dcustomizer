   if for some reason the program can't write your new file

   file is that you can post here or PM to me so that can see
   exactly what failed .

v0.2.5
* fixed "read-only" problem people were having...
   now the program should have no problem if the file has been set to "Read Only".
   I tested by setting the file ot read only in total commander,
   have not confirmed if this will work if the xml file is part of the original rom
   as there is no manilla 2d rom for the titan yet
