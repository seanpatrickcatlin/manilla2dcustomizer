v0.3.17
* added awesome looking new icon (thanks to twolf)
* No longer has hard coded folder paths so
  * Non English roms should now be supported
     (Tested on Italian WM6 Professional emulator image)
  * installing to storage card should now be supported 
* Added somewhat extensive error logging,
   if for some reason the program can't write your new file
   it should let you know, and tell you where an error log text
   file is that you can post here or PM to me so that can see
   exactly what failed .

v0.2.5
* fixed "read-only" problem people were having...
   now the program should have no problem if the file has been set to "Read Only".
   I tested by setting the file ot read only in total commander,
   have not confirmed if this will work if the xml file is part of the original rom
   as there is no manilla 2d rom for the titan yet
