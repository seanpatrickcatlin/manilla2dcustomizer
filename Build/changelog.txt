v0.15.176
- Added softkey dialog
    -- Only allows to set the name and command, not the command parameters
    -- The command must be an exe file
- Updated donator list

Oct-25-2008
v0.14.166
- Changed the underlying way the theme manager deals with XLM changes, previously
    the theme manager would only apply "RECT" and "POS" values, now the theme
    manager will use the actual file from the new theme, and then just update
    the themes xml file with the correct paths for the existing Manilla 2D images.
- updated theme readme with my thoghts and recommendations on themes and more
    details about how the theme manager process works
- List of available themes is now auto sorted alphabetically
- Updated about page with usernames of contributors
- added an artificial 5 seconds wait after disabling M2D, this is to give
    Manilla2D.exe time to unload itself and release any image files it might
    still have a handle on

Oct-19-2008
v0.13.154
- a few small bugfixes
- updated about page with usernames of contributors

Oct-16-2008
v0.12.148
- Fixed bug with launcher changing... used to be broken if the user didn't have 
   3, 6, or 9 rows.  Now it will round to one of those numbers and allow users
   to change launcher settings as before.
- Added some more wait cursors (the pinwheel thing) to give user more feedback that
   M2DC is not "frozen".
- Attempted to support Windows Mobile 5... not sure if it worked or now, let me know
   if yo \u have a windows mobile 5 device and try to install this.
- fixed apptodate support, the xml was not pointing to the correct location
- Added Support for a scrollable UI... so now this should work on non qvga devices,
   and also work in landscape mode, and react appropriately when the SIP panel appears
- Added an about dialog, donate $1 or more to get your name added to the donator list

Oct-07-2008
v0.11.133
- fixed bug where the m2dc theme backup did not restore via the restore button
- added preview functionality
  -- if a theme file (m2dc or zip) has a file named "preview.jpg" or "preview.jpeg"
     then the file will be saved to the "\M2DC\Themes" filder and the file will be
     displayed in the lower right hand corner of the theme screen, this file will be
     scaled to fit, the recommended size of the preview is 75x100

Oct-05-2008
v0.10.130
- changed the way that M2DC stores and access theme files.
   Now no longer are themes copied to the install directory,
   You have 2 ways of getting M2DC to recogize your theme files.
   1) Copy the theme files directly to the "M2DC\Themes" filder
   2) Press the "Add THeme" button.
   When you press teh add theme button the theme will not be copied,
   instead of copying the theme M2DC now keeps track of all of the
   themes that you have added and displays to you the themes files
   that exist on the system.
   So now you can keep all of your themes on your SD card with no problems.
- no longer removes the original theme file during add theme
- added more prompts for theme deletion

v0.9.127
* alot of gui cleanup
* no longer forces user to make a backup of current theme
* no longer copies files when importing, now completely moves the file
* added "Home" tab which allows for easy disablign of items on the Home Widget
* backup/restore page now has 4 buttons, separated the theme and xml
   backup/restore for my own selfish reasons
* Now tries to read all position inforamtion from themes... ie 2DC will ready and
   apply all line form the HTCHomeSettings.xml that contain the string "POS" or
   "RECT".  To disable an item in hte xml in a nice way for M2DC to pick up on the
   fact that you have hidden it please set POS values to "-1,-1" and RECT values to
   "-1,-1,-1,-1"
* added some more user feedback in some areas where the screen used to hang alot
* updated themes readme file with some more documentation

Oct-02-2008
v0.8.111
* tried to fix all errors
* latest theme supports were broken due to my not parsing the xml correctly
* this version should work with the latest M2D binaries and the old ones
* I have only tested the new M2D package
* there might be some issues with clock enabling/disabling on themes... these
   will probablly remain until a skinner tells me what they want the proper
   action to disable clocks to be

Sep-30-2008
v0.7.104
* oops, the theme management support for 0.6.97 was not future proof, so when updating to
   this version your default theme will be applied.  Your themes wil lstill exist, you
   will just have to re apply them
* added support for *.zip theme files... the cath is that the zip file must contain a 
   HTCHomeSettings.xml file in it
* added support for multiple instances of the same named node, thanks to ababrekar from
   xda-developers forexample
* added support for 3, 4, or 5 columsn, and 3, 6, or 9 rows in the launcher, thanks to 
   kidnamedAlbert from xda-developers for example
* attempt at more robust theme support, now reads and uses all values from
   Imageslist, TabWidget, and HomeWidget in hte theme HTCHomeSettings.xml file,
   I still see some bugs though (digital clock showing up in weird places, maybe due to
   the skin developer removing the actual file rather than commenting out the xml
   element or just giving the xml element an invalid name)

Sep-28-2008
v0.6.97
* Theme management support, see the forums and the include readme.txt
   file for more information
* modified the apptodate xml file location
   (now looks for it directly from the subverison repository web access)
* fixed icon support for apptodate
* added a restore tab, this tab will tell all the other tabs to
   restore the default values to M2D
* some small GUI changes in order to make it look more natural on WM6
* mostly automated the build process
   (only needs human interaction to clean up changleog
   and enter google code upload password)

Sep-18-2008 22:25 CDT
v0.3.17
* added awesome looking new icon (thanks to twolf)
* No longer has hard coded folder paths so
  * Non English roms should now be supported
     (Tested on Italian WM6 Professional emulator image)
  * installing to storage card should now be supported 
* Added somewhat extensive error logging,
   if for some reason the program can't write your new file
   it should let you know, and tell you where an error log text
   file is that you can post here or PM to me so that can see
   exactly what failed .


Sep-18-2008 09:35 CDT
v0.2.5
* fixed "read-only" problem people were having...
   now the program should have no problem if the file has been set to "Read Only".
   I tested by setting the file ot read only in total commander,
   have not confirmed if this will work if the xml file is part of the original rom
   as there is no manilla 2d rom for the titan yet
