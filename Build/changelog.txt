Manilla 2D Customizer changelog

Oct-05-2008
v0.9.126
* alot of gui cleanup
* no longer forces user to make a backup of current theme
* no longer copies files when importing, now completely moves the file
* added "Home" tab which allows for easy disablign of items on the Home Widget
* backup/restore page now has 4 buttons, separated the theme and xml
   backup/restore for my own selfish reasons
* Now tries to read all position inforamtion from themes... ie 2DC will ready and
   apply all line form the HTCHomeSettings.xml that contain the string "POS" or
   "RECT".  To disable an item in hte xml in a nice way for M2DC to pick up on the
   fact that you have hidden it please set POS values to "-1,-1" and RECT values to
   "-1,-1,-1,-1"
* added some more user feedback in some areas where the screen used to hang alot
* updated themes readme file with some more documentation

Oct-02-2008
v0.8.111
* tried to fix all errors
* latest theme supports were broken due to my not parsing the xml correctly
* this version should work with the latest M2D binaries and the old ones
* I have only tested the new M2D package
* there might be some issues with clock enabling/disabling on themes... these
   will probablly remain until a skinner tells me what they want the proper
   action to disable clocks to be

v0.7.104
* oops, the theme management support for 0.6.97 was not future proof, so when updating to
   this version your default theme will be applied.  Your themes wil lstill exist, you
   will just have to re apply them
* added support for *.zip theme files... the cath is that the zip file must contain a 
   HTCHomeSettings.xml file in it
* added support for multiple instances of the same named node, thanks to ababrekar from
   xda-developers forexample
* added support for 3, 4, or 5 columsn, and 3, 6, or 9 rows in the launcher, thanks to 
   kidnamedAlbert from xda-developers for example
* attempt at more robust theme support, now reads and uses all values from
   Imageslist, TabWidget, and HomeWidget in hte theme HTCHomeSettings.xml file,
   I still see some bugs though (digital clock showing up in weird places, maybe due to
   the skin developer removing the actual file rather than commenting out the xml
   element or just giving the xml element an invalid name)

v0.6.97
* Theme management support, see the forums and the include readme.txt
   file for more information
* modified the apptodate xml file location
   (now looks for it directly from the subverison repository web access)
* fixed icon support for apptodate
* added a restore tab, this tab will tell all the other tabs to
   restore the default values to M2D
* some small GUI changes in order to make it look more natural on WM6
* mostly automated the build process
   (only needs human interaction to clean up changleog
   and enter google code upload password)

v0.3.17
* added awesome looking new icon (thanks to twolf)
* No longer has hard coded folder paths so
  * Non English roms should now be supported
     (Tested on Italian WM6 Professional emulator image)
  * installing to storage card should now be supported 
* Added somewhat extensive error logging,
   if for some reason the program can't write your new file
   it should let you know, and tell you where an error log text
   file is that you can post here or PM to me so that can see
   exactly what failed .

v0.2.5
* fixed "read-only" problem people were having...
   now the program should have no problem if the file has been set to "Read Only".
   I tested by setting the file ot read only in total commander,
   have not confirmed if this will work if the xml file is part of the original rom
   as there is no manilla 2d rom for the titan yet
